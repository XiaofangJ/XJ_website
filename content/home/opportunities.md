We are looking for self-motivated and enthusiastic postdocs and visiting scholars to join our team. 

The National Library of Medicine (NLM)’s Intramural Research Program (IRP) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking two postdoctoral fellows in the area of Bioinformatics and Microbiome Data Science. These positions are located on the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  Bethesda is a bustling urban community next to Washington, D.C. The overarching aim of this laboratory is to use computational skills to interpret biological patterns from large-scale microbiome data with the ultimate goal to advance microbiome-based diagnosis and therapeutics. The successful applicants will be involved in the development of new computational tools and statistical methods for the analysis and integration of microbial genomic and metagenomic data to investigate the relationships between human health and the microbiome.

These positions will provide extensive career development opportunities at NIH, including interactions with leading experts in a wide range of disciplines in the biomedical sciences, proximity to NLM’s advanced biomedical databases and information systems, and the use of cutting-edge technology resources for biomedical research.  Dr. Jiang, a newly appointed Principle Investigator, is dedicated to providing a supportive environment for high-quality mentoring to develop candidates into well-rounded, independent researchers ready for future advancement.

## Minimum Qualifications:
The ideal candidates may or may not be United States citizens and must have a doctoral degree and possess exceptional communication skills and a willingness to collaborate with other researchers. They will also be expected to author and co-author scientific papers.
We are looking for individuals with Ph.D. in computer science, physics, statistics, mathematics,bioinformatics or other relevant disciplines; proficiency in machine learning and/or large-scale data analysis; a record of high-performance scientific programming with one or more of the popular programming languages, e.g., C++, Python, Go, and R; familiarity with basic biology; a willingness to learn new tools and knowledge.

## How to Apply:
Interested persons should send a cover letter, curriculum vitae (CV), a brief (half-page) statement of research and interests, and three references with contact information to Dr. Xiaofang Jiang (xiaofang.jiang@nih.gov).  Applications will be reviewed immediately after submission.

*The NIH is dedicated to building a diverse community in its training and employment programs.*
